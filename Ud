# Test Case: Interface Status Check for Router

# Test Parameters
router_ip="10.133.35.156"
ssh_username="your_ssh_username"

# 1. Ping Test
ping_result=$(ping -c 4 $router_ip)
echo "Ping Test Result: $ping_result"
# Expected Outcome: Successful replies indicate an up interface. Timeouts or unreachable messages suggest a potentially down interface.

# 2. Check Interface Status
interface_status=$(show interface status | grep $router_ip)
echo "Interface Status: $interface_status"
# Expected Outcome: Look for the entry corresponding to the IP address $router_ip. 
# If the status is "up," consider the interface up; if it's "down," consider the interface down.

# 3. Traceroute
traceroute_result=$(traceroute $router_ip)
echo "Traceroute Result: $traceroute_result"
# Expected Outcome: Review the output for each hop. 
# If you see a series of asterisks (*) or timeouts, it could indicate a down interface.

# 4. Telnet
telnet $router_ip
# Expected Outcome: If the connection is successful, consider the interface up. 
# If the connection fails, it may indicate a down interface.

# 5. SSH
ssh $ssh_username@$router_ip
# Expected Outcome: If the SSH connection is successful, consider the interface up. 
# If the connection fails, it may indicate a down interface.

# Note: Ensure that appropriate credentials are used for Telnet and SSH tests.
