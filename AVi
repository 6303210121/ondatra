There are two ways to install the protobuf compiler. If you're on Ubuntu you can use this:

sudo apt install protobuf-compiler

Then of course there's the standard way:

go get -u google.golang.org/protobuf

Here forward it's just adding the path. Assuming when you installed Go you did this,

echo 'export GOPATH=$HOME/Go' >> $HOME/.bashrc
source $HOME/.bashrc

Now you can just extend this:

echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin' >> $HOME/.bashrc
source $HOME/.bashrc

Strangely protoc can't expand ~.

>>>> Another way

For Linux Ubuntu 20, only install with snap

snap install protobuf --classic

or via apt, with:

sudo apt install protobuf-compiler

>>> go generate ./...
>>> sudo rm -r public
